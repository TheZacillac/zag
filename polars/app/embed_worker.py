"""
Continuous embedding worker service.

This worker is a critical part of the RAG pipeline. It runs continuously,
polling the database for text chunks that need to be embedded, calling Ollama's
embedding API in batches, and writing the resulting vectors back to PostgreSQL.

Key features:
- Batch processing for efficiency (default: 64 chunks at once)
- Row-level locking (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED) to prevent duplicate work
- Connection pooling for database performance
- Comprehensive error handling with different strategies per error type
- Graceful degradation when Ollama is slow or unavailable

The worker is designed to be run as a long-lived service (e.g., in Docker).
Multiple instances can run concurrently thanks to the row-level locking strategy.

    Fetch chunks that need embeddings from the database using row-level locking.

    This function uses "FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED" to enable concurrent processing:
    - FOR UPDATE: Locks the selected rows so other workers can't modify them

    This pattern allows multiple embed_worker instances to run in parallel safely.
    Each worker will grab different chunks and process them independently.
